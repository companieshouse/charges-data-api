## Development

Common commands used for development and running locally can be found in the Makefile, each make target has a
description which can be listed by running `make help`

```text
Target               Description
------               -----------
all                  Calls methods required to build a locally runnable version, typically the build target
build                Pull down any dependencies and compile code into an executable if required
clean                Reset repo to pre-build state (i.e. a clean checkout state)
deps                 Install dependencies
package              Create a single versioned deployable package (i.e. jar, zip, tar, etc.). May be dependent on the build target being run before package
sonar                Run sonar scan
test                 Run all test-* targets (convenience method for developers)
test-integration     Run integration tests
test-unit            Run unit tests

## Terraform ECS

### What does this code do?

The code present in this repository is used to define and deploy a dockerised container in AWS ECS.
This is done by calling a [module](https://github.com/companieshouse/terraform-modules/tree/main/aws/ecs) from terraform-modules. Application specific attributes are injected and the service is then deployed using Terraform via the CICD platform 'Concourse'.

Application specific attributes | Value                                | Description
:---------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------
**ECS Cluster**        | public-data                                     | ECS cluster (stack) the service belongs to
**Load balancer**      |{env}-chs-apichgovuk <br> {env}-chs-apichgovuk-private                                 | The load balancer that sits in front of the service
**Concourse pipeline**     |[Pipeline link](https://ci-platform.companieshouse.gov.uk/teams/team-development/pipelines/charges-data-api) <br> [Pipeline code](https://github.com/companieshouse/ci-pipelines/blob/master/pipelines/ssplatform/team-development/charges-data-api)                                  | Concourse pipeline link in shared services
